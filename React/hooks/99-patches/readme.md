# Patch Folder

As we know, the only different between source code with bugs and source code without bugs is how long it has been out for.

As problems are discovered, my plan is to put the fixes in this folder under the same file structure as the course and include the fixes.

When I update the course, I'll incorporate the fixes and remove the folders with the problems here.
